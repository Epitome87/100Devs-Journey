# Class 09 - Live Networking

This is a very short, 50 minute lecture. After the lecture, time was spent networking -- which isn't really something I can participate in as a part of the catch-up crew.

## Agenda

- Review: How to Network
- Do: Networking Night
- Homework: Layouts

## Networking

**Read the Room**

- Loose or formal? If really chill event, maybe drop of your title and what you do.
- Tech-related? If not, maybe don't introduce yourself as software engineer if it's not relevant.

Introduction format:

1. Name
2. Title
3. What do you do?
4. Why are you here? (Try to tie with the meetup theme)
5. Greeting

Example introduction:

```
Hi,

I'm Leon.
I'm a software engineer.
I help people build fullstack web applications.
I'm trying to learn how to network better.
Nice to meet you all!
```
