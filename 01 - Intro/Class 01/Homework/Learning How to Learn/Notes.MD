# Learning How to Learn

My notes as I journey my way through Coursera's "Learning How to Learn" course.

## Week 1 - What is Learning?

### Focused Versus Diffuse Thinking

#### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

Two fundamentally different ways of thinking:

1. Focused: Concentrate intently on something you're trying to learn or understand
2. Diffuse: More relaxed thinking style. Look at things broadly from a big-picture perspective.

Metaphors and analogies are really helpful when learning new things.

As an analogy for focused and diffuse modes of thinking, imagine a pinball machine. For focused mode, we have many bumpers that are ball (thought) will bounce off of, so the ball can't go very far without bumping into a bumper, creating a thinking pattern we know the location and shape of. Off in the corner there's another thought -- a new thought. But we don't know what shape it is, or how to get to it.

To solve this, we approach the thought from a diffuse mode -- a broad perspective. This pinball machine has much less bumpers, so our ball can travel around more easily without getting stopped. Make new neural connections travel around new pathways. Can't focus in as tightly, or understand the finest aspects, but you can at least get to the initial place you need to be in to home in on a solution.

Another analogy: Diffuse is a flashing set so it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in one area. Focused mode would have its light cast very strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else.

Can't be in both modes of thinking at the same time. Being in one mode limits access to the other mode's way of thinking.

#### Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley -- Introduction to the Course Structure

Course is meant to reframe how we think about learning, reduce frustration, increase understanding. Take the ideas taught and apply them to the subjects we are trying to improve in.
New ways to hold focus, embed material. Condense key ideas to grasp more easily. Tips to help prevent procrastination.

#### Welcome and Course Information

**Course Objectives**

By the end of the course, we expect you to be able to do the following:

- Explain the difference between focused and diffuse modes of thinking.
- Explain what a chunk is, and how and why you can and should enhance your chunking skills.
- Explain how working memory and long term memory differ from one another.
- Describe key techniques to help students learn most efficiently such as: the Pomodoro, metaphor, story, visualization, deliberate practice, and interleaving.
- Describe actions that hinder students from learning most effectively, such as procrastination, over-learning, Einstellung, choking, multi-tasking, illusions of learning, and lack of sleep.
- Describe the most important aspects of proper test preparation.
- Explain the importance of “mindset” in learning.

**Further Reading**

A great book, called _A Mind for Numbers_, by Barbara Oakley. It's not only for math and science!

#### Guidance in Applying for Continuing Education or Professional Development Credit

A short read. Not really relevant.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes -- Or, a Little Dali Will Do You

Salvador Dali: Would sit in chair, dangle keys over ground, slowly fall asleep. The falling keys would wake him up. As he was awakened, he'd gather up diffuse mode ideas, and go back into focus mode with those new connections and ideas.
Thomas Edison: Like Dali, would have a method where something would wake him up _just_ as he drifts off to sleep. Bring diffuse mode ideas into the focused world.

Your mind needs to be able to go back adn forth between the two modes for effective learning. Like muscles, have to do a little work every day to build neural structure.

**Summary**

- Metaphors and analogies provide powerful techniques for learning
- Focused and diffuse modes, each help us learn in very different ways
- Learning something difficult takes time. Brain needs to alternate ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material.

#### What is Learning?

We are not consciously aware of how our brains work. most the heavy lifting is down below our level of conscious.
When you learn something new, many new synapses (connections) are formed on the dendrites of neurons.
There are a million billion synapses.
We will learn how to take advantage of unconscious mind and also sleep, to make it easier to learn new things and solve problems.

#### Introductory Quiz (An easy, quick review of re levant info)

Just a "quiz" where all answers were basically given to us. It was a way for the course to basically acknowledge we were reading a list of facts about the site they were providing.

#### Get to Know Your Classmates

Some light reading about how we can interact on the forum.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

#### A Procrastination Preview

Why does it arise?
Tools to address it.

When you look at something you'd really not do, we active insular cortext - area of brain associated with pain. Brain switches your attention away from this negative stimulation to something else. But researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working on what they didn't like, that neuro discomfort disappeared!

We typically:

1. Observe, unhappy feeling
2. You funnel attention onto a more pleasant task
3. Feel happy (_temporarily_)

_Pomodoro_: Italian for tomato (which the timers typically looked like). A technique involving a timer. 25 minutes of _uninterrupted focus_. Give reward when done (few minutes of web surfing, coffee, stretching, chatting) so brain enjoyable change its focus for a while.

#### Practice Makes Permanent

Why do topics related to math and science seem to be the most challenging? It may be related, in part, to the abstract nature of the ideas.
In math, there's no analogous things you can point to, their terms are more abstract.

But what about terms like love, hope? Those are abstract. Yes, but they're related to emotions, which we can _feel_ even if we can't see or point to concrete examples. This means it's important to practice with ideas, to help enhance and strengthen neural connections.

Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract, the more practice required to bring ideas into reality. _Practice makes permanent_.

Study something, hard and intently. Take break, change focus. During this time of relaxation, your brain diffuse mode has time to work away in the background and help you out with conceptual understanding. If you don't do this and instead learn by cramming, your wall of knowledge will not have time to dry, and will be a jumbled, collapsed mess -- a poor foundation!

If you have problems with procrastination, pomodoro helps.

#### Introduction to Memory

Two types of memory are related.

_Long term memory_

Trying to hold a few ideas in mind, connect them together to understand a concept or solve a problem, using _working memory_
Part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and con processing in your mind. Centered out of the prefrontal cortex (and other parts to access long term memories)
Holds only about four _chunks_ of information. We group memory items into chunks so it seems like our working memory is bigger than it actually is.
Often need to repeat what you're trying to work with so it stays in your working memory. Repeat a phone number until you can write it down. You may find yourself shutting eyes so no other items intrude into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate. It's like an inefficient mental blackboard.

Long term memory is like a storage warehouse. Distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long-term memories stored in different regions of brain. When you first try to put an item of info in long-term memory, have to revisit it a few times in order to find it later. Room for billions of items! So many they can bury each other; difficult to find info you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. Store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.

When we encounter something new, often use working brain. To move it into long-term, often takes time and practice. To help, use a technique called **spaced repetitio**n. Repeat what you're trying to retain, but space it out over a number of days. Repeating 20x in one evening won't stick nearly as well as practicing 20x over 20 days. Need to leave time for our wall of knowledge to dry!

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

Just being awake creates toxic products in brain! When we sleep, your brain cells shrink. Causes increase in the space between your brain cells - unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So sleep keeps brain clean and healthy!

Taking a test without enough sleep means you're operating with a brain that has metabolic toxins floating around -- poisons that make it so you can't think very clearly. Like a car with sugar in gas tank.

Sleep is important part of learning and memory process. During sleep, brain tidies and ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning. Erases the less important parts of memory, simultaneously strengthens areas that you need / want to remember. Rehearses some of the tougher parts of what you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen them. Also show to make difference in ability to figure out difficult problems and understand what you're trying to learn.

Must plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work. If going over what you're learning right before nap, you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. If you set it in mind that you _want_ to dream about the material, improves your chances. Dreaming about what you're studying can enhance your ability to understand. Consolidates memories into easier to grasp chunks.

#### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

Learn more by active engagement over passive listening.
Jogging, exercise help think in a diffuse mode -- new ideas may emerge.
Learning and memory neurons are always newly-emerging.
Being surrounded by other, stimulating people can help with these neurons.
In absence of nourishing environment, exercise can help. Recess, moments of pause -- these all help!
Being in a creative environment with others who are creative. Talking and trying to explain ideas.
Success isn't necessarily achieved by being smart -- persistent, passionate.

### Summary

A summary, in the words of Barabara Oakley:

```
Although living brains are pretty complex, this week we've used metaphor and analogy and zombies to help simplify matters. In essence people have two fundamentally different modes of thinking that, for the purposes of this course, we've labeled focused and diffuse. We used a simple pinball analogy to help us understand the differences between the modes. The focused mode has tight spacing for the rubber bumpers, which seems to, in some sense help keep your thoughts concentrated. The diffuse mode on the other hand has more widely spaced bumpers that allow for more broad ranging ways of thinking. The focus mood is centered on the prefrontal cortex and it often seems to involve thinking about things you are somewhat familiar with. For example if you're familiar with multiplication and you're trying to solve a multiplication problem, or you're trying to find a word that rhymes with another word. You're probably stepping along the somewhat familiar pathways of the focused mode. But if you're trying to solve or figure out something new, it often cries out for the more broad ranging perspectives of the diffuse mode. This mode, as it turns out, is representative of the brain's many neural resting states.

Creative thinkers throughout history, whatever their discipline have found ways to access the diffuse mode often more directly and quickly. But we all access this mode quite naturally when we do things like go for a walk or take a shower or even just drift off to sleep. When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation, the course of living our daily life. It's often a good idea once you've focused directly on the situation. To let things settle back and take a bit more time. That way more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode.

The thing is it often takes time for neural processing to take place, and time, as well, to build the new neural structures that allow us to learn something new. This is why tackling procrastination is so very important. The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the Pomodoro technique. That brief, 25 minute stretch of focuses concentration followed by a bit of mental relaxation. It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics.

Memory of course is an important aspect of learning. There are four slots in our working memory. Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind. In that sense working memory is like a not very good blackboard. Long term memory, on the other hand, is like a storage warehouse. If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long-term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up. It's never a good idea to cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day. Because that's like trying to build muscle by lifting weights all in one day there's no time for solid structures to grow. We've also learned that the importance of sleep and washing away the toxins that develop during our days activities. We want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep the night before cause its like trying to think with poison on the brain. And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping both improve our memory and our ability to learn.
