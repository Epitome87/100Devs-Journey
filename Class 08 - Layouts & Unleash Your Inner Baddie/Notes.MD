## Review: How to Network

**Example Coffee Chat Invitation**

```
Hi Leon,

It was a pleasure meeting you last night! The event was so well done and it was exciting meeting such an amazing group of people. I hope you are enjoying a well-deserved break after pulling it all together!

As I mentioned last night, I'm just starting my engineering career and would love to learn from successful people such as yourself. Please let me know if there might be a time you are free to grab a virtual coffee over the next week or two. Before 9am or after 5pm tends to work best for me, but I'm happy to accommodate what works for you. Thanks!

Also, I don't know if you saw this yet, but someone just bought a $375k first edition Pokemon booster box and it wound up being fake! The Guardian covered it (link) and I remember you mentioned being a big fan. Have a great rest of the week!

Cheers,
Bob

- Compliment, butter-up
- Generous time-range of meeting when doing your ask
- Provide value
- Thank them for your time

TAV - Thank, Ask, Value!

Keep Google doc on each person you meet -- everything you talked about, learned about them. Pull it out on mobile before each meetup so you can engage in conversations that are more meaningful and thoughtful. Think of ways to provide value.

## Responsive Basics

Fixed Vs. Responsive

- A site that doesn't adjust to screen changes is fixed
- A site that responds to a device's screen is responsive

**What Makes A Site Responsive?**

- Fluid: Using percentages
- Elastic: Use of ems and rems
- Content Decisions: What should show at various sizes. Media queries

## Homework - Layouts

Homework this week is completing the essence of 3 different layouts. As I am catching up and am comfortable with the basics of HTML, CSS, and layouts, I will only complete these if time permits.
