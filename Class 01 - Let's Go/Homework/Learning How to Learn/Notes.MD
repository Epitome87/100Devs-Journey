# Learning How to Learn

My notes as I journey my way through Coursera's "Learning How to Learn" course.

## Week 1 - What is Learning?

### Focused Versus Diffuse Thinking

#### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

Two fundamentally different ways of thinking:

1. Focused: Concentrate intently on something you're trying to learn or understand
2. Diffuse: More relaxed thinking style. Look at things broadly from a big-picture perspective.

Metaphors and analogies are really helpful when learning new things.

As an analogy for focused and diffuse modes of thinking, imagine a pinball machine. For focused mode, we have many bumpers that are ball (thought) will bounce off of, so the ball can't go very far without bumping into a bumper, creating a thinking pattern we know the location and shape of. Off in the corner there's another thought -- a new thought. But we don't know what shape it is, or how to get to it.

To solve this, we approach the thought from a diffuse mode -- a broad perspective. This pinball machine has much less bumpers, so our ball can travel around more easily without getting stopped. Make new neural connections travel around new pathways. Can't focus in as tightly, or understand the finest aspects, but you can at least get to the initial place you need to be in to home in on a solution.

Another analogy: Diffuse is a flashing set so it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in one area. Focused mode would have its light cast very strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else.

Can't be in both modes of thinking at the same time. Being in one mode limits access to the other mode's way of thinking.

#### Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley -- Introduction to the Course Structure

Course is meant to reframe how we think about learning, reduce frustration, increase understanding. Take the ideas taught and apply them to the subjects we are trying to improve in.
New ways to hold focus, embed material. Condense key ideas to grasp more easily. Tips to help prevent procrastination.

#### Welcome and Course Information

**Course Objectives**

By the end of the course, we expect you to be able to do the following:

- Explain the difference between focused and diffuse modes of thinking.
- Explain what a chunk is, and how and why you can and should enhance your chunking skills.
- Explain how working memory and long term memory differ from one another.
- Describe key techniques to help students learn most efficiently such as: the Pomodoro, metaphor, story, visualization, deliberate practice, and interleaving.
- Describe actions that hinder students from learning most effectively, such as procrastination, over-learning, Einstellung, choking, multi-tasking, illusions of learning, and lack of sleep.
- Describe the most important aspects of proper test preparation.
- Explain the importance of “mindset” in learning.

**Further Reading**

A great book, called _A Mind for Numbers_, by Barbara Oakley. It's not only for math and science!

#### Guidance in Applying for Continuing Education or Professional Development Credit

A short read. Not really relevant.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes -- Or, a Little Dali Will Do You

Salvador Dali: Would sit in chair, dangle keys over ground, slowly fall asleep. The falling keys would wake him up. As he was awakened, he'd gather up diffuse mode ideas, and go back into focus mode with those new connections and ideas.
Thomas Edison: Like Dali, would have a method where something would wake him up _just_ as he drifts off to sleep. Bring diffuse mode ideas into the focused world.

Your mind needs to be able to go back adn forth between the two modes for effective learning. Like muscles, have to do a little work every day to build neural structure.

**Summary**

- Metaphors and analogies provide powerful techniques for learning
- Focused and diffuse modes, each help us learn in very different ways
- Learning something difficult takes time. Brain needs to alternate ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material.

#### What is Learning?

We are not consciously aware of how our brains work. most the heavy lifting is down below our level of conscious.
When you learn something new, many new synapses (connections) are formed on the dendrites of neurons.
There are a million billion synapses.
We will learn how to take advantage of unconscious mind and also sleep, to make it easier to learn new things and solve problems.

#### Introductory Quiz (An easy, quick review of re levant info)

Just a "quiz" where all answers were basically given to us. It was a way for the course to basically acknowledge we were reading a list of facts about the site they were providing.

#### Get to Know Your Classmates

Some light reading about how we can interact on the forum.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

#### A Procrastination Preview

Why does it arise?
Tools to address it.

When you look at something you'd really not do, we active insular cortext - area of brain associated with pain. Brain switches your attention away from this negative stimulation to something else. But researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working on what they didn't like, that neuro discomfort disappeared!

We typically:

1. Observe, unhappy feeling
2. You funnel attention onto a more pleasant task
3. Feel happy (_temporarily_)

_Pomodoro_: Italian for tomato (which the timers typically looked like). A technique involving a timer. 25 minutes of _uninterrupted focus_. Give reward when done (few minutes of web surfing, coffee, stretching, chatting) so brain enjoyable change its focus for a while.

#### Practice Makes Permanent

Why do topics related to math and science seem to be the most challenging? It may be related, in part, to the abstract nature of the ideas.
In math, there's no analogous things you can point to, their terms are more abstract.

But what about terms like love, hope? Those are abstract. Yes, but they're related to emotions, which we can _feel_ even if we can't see or point to concrete examples. This means it's important to practice with ideas, to help enhance and strengthen neural connections.

Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract, the more practice required to bring ideas into reality. _Practice makes permanent_.

Study something, hard and intently. Take break, change focus. During this time of relaxation, your brain diffuse mode has time to work away in the background and help you out with conceptual understanding. If you don't do this and instead learn by cramming, your wall of knowledge will not have time to dry, and will be a jumbled, collapsed mess -- a poor foundation!

If you have problems with procrastination, pomodoro helps.

#### Introduction to Memory

Two types of memory are related.

_Long term memory_

Trying to hold a few ideas in mind, connect them together to understand a concept or solve a problem, using _working memory_
Part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and con processing in your mind. Centered out of the prefrontal cortex (and other parts to access long term memories)
Holds only about four _chunks_ of information. We group memory items into chunks so it seems like our working memory is bigger than it actually is.
Often need to repeat what you're trying to work with so it stays in your working memory. Repeat a phone number until you can write it down. You may find yourself shutting eyes so no other items intrude into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate. It's like an inefficient mental blackboard.

Long term memory is like a storage warehouse. Distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long-term memories stored in different regions of brain. When you first try to put an item of info in long-term memory, have to revisit it a few times in order to find it later. Room for billions of items! So many they can bury each other; difficult to find info you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. Store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.

When we encounter something new, often use working brain. To move it into long-term, often takes time and practice. To help, use a technique called **spaced repetition**. Repeat what you're trying to retain, but space it out over a number of days. Repeating 20x in one evening won't stick nearly as well as practicing 20x over 20 days. Need to leave time for our wall of knowledge to dry!

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

Just being awake creates toxic products in brain! When we sleep, your brain cells shrink. Causes increase in the space between your brain cells - unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So sleep keeps brain clean and healthy!

Taking a test without enough sleep means you're operating with a brain that has metabolic toxins floating around -- poisons that make it so you can't think very clearly. Like a car with sugar in gas tank.

Sleep is important part of learning and memory process. During sleep, brain tidies and ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning. Erases the less important parts of memory, simultaneously strengthens areas that you need / want to remember. Rehearses some of the tougher parts of what you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen them. Also show to make difference in ability to figure out difficult problems and understand what you're trying to learn.

Must plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work. If going over what you're learning right before nap, you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. If you set it in mind that you _want_ to dream about the material, improves your chances. Dreaming about what you're studying can enhance your ability to understand. Consolidates memories into easier to grasp chunks.

#### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

Learn more by active engagement over passive listening.
Jogging, exercise help think in a diffuse mode -- new ideas may emerge.
Learning and memory neurons are always newly-emerging.
Being surrounded by other, stimulating people can help with these neurons.
In absence of nourishing environment, exercise can help. Recess, moments of pause -- these all help!
Being in a creative environment with others who are creative. Talking and trying to explain ideas.
Success isn't necessarily achieved by being smart -- persistent, passionate.

### Summary

A summary, in the words of Barabara Oakley:

```
Although living brains are pretty complex, this week we've used metaphor and analogy and zombies to help simplify matters. In essence people have two fundamentally different modes of thinking that, for the purposes of this course, we've labeled focused and diffuse. We used a simple pinball analogy to help us understand the differences between the modes. The focused mode has tight spacing for the rubber bumpers, which seems to, in some sense help keep your thoughts concentrated. The diffuse mode on the other hand has more widely spaced bumpers that allow for more broad ranging ways of thinking. The focus mood is centered on the prefrontal cortex and it often seems to involve thinking about things you are somewhat familiar with. For example if you're familiar with multiplication and you're trying to solve a multiplication problem, or you're trying to find a word that rhymes with another word. You're probably stepping along the somewhat familiar pathways of the focused mode. But if you're trying to solve or figure out something new, it often cries out for the more broad ranging perspectives of the diffuse mode. This mode, as it turns out, is representative of the brain's many neural resting states.

Creative thinkers throughout history, whatever their discipline have found ways to access the diffuse mode often more directly and quickly. But we all access this mode quite naturally when we do things like go for a walk or take a shower or even just drift off to sleep. When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation, the course of living our daily life. It's often a good idea once you've focused directly on the situation. To let things settle back and take a bit more time. That way more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode.

The thing is it often takes time for neural processing to take place, and time, as well, to build the new neural structures that allow us to learn something new. This is why tackling procrastination is so very important. The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the Pomodoro technique. That brief, 25 minute stretch of focuses concentration followed by a bit of mental relaxation. It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics.

Memory of course is an important aspect of learning. There are four slots in our working memory. Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind. In that sense working memory is like a not very good blackboard. Long term memory, on the other hand, is like a storage warehouse. If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long-term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up. It's never a good idea to cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day. Because that's like trying to build muscle by lifting weights all in one day there's no time for solid structures to grow. We've also learned that the importance of sleep and washing away the toxins that develop during our days activities. We want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep the night before cause its like trying to think with poison on the brain. And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping both improve our memory and our ability to learn.

## Week 2 - Chunking

### Chunking - The Essentials

#### Introduction to Chunking

How can we form chunks?
How can we use them to improve our understanding of material?
How they can make us do better on test?
Illusions of competence in learning -- using ineffective methods of study to fool ourselves into thinking we're learning.
What study methods are bad? Which are good?
What is overlearning?
Make study time more valuable by interleaving -- intelligent variety in studies

#### What is a Chunk?

- Compact packages of info that your mind can easily access.
- Mental leap that helps you unit bits of information together through meaning. New logical hold makes it easier to remember, easier to fit into large picture of what you're learning.
- Chunks are pieces of info bound together through meaning or use
- Mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information
- Focused practice and repetition - the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks.
- Small chunks become larger
- Once you chunk an idea, you don't need remember all the little underlying details
- Like getting dressed: You think "I'll get dressed", and it's easy and automatic, yet we're engaging in many different thoughts and actions to complete the idea.

#### How to Form a Chunk - Part 1

Our end goal with information is to form a single chunk out of many smaller ones

- Helps to start out with a worked-through example. Like listening to a song before trying to play it yourself.
- But this approach on a math problem, for instance, may have us focused too much on _why_ an individual step works, rather than understanding the connection between steps.
- So it's more like using a roadmap: pay attention to what's around us, and soon we can figure out how to get there on our own (and even new ways).

#### How to Form a Chunk - Part 2

First step: Focus undivided attention on the info you want to chunk.
Second step: Understand the basic idea you're trying to understand. Comprehending essence of a type of math problem, for instance.

- Just because you see it -- or that you understand it -- doesn't mean you can actually do it. You have to do it yourself!

Third step: Practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of teh big-picture context, so you can see not just how, but when. Go beyond initial problem, see more broadly. Repeated practice!

Learning takes place in two ways:

- Bottom up learning (chunking), where practice and rep can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, easily access it whenever.
- Top-down big picture process, allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.

Both process are vital!

_Context_ is where top-down and bottom-up meet.

Chunking may involve your learning _how_ to use a certain problem solving technique. Context means learning _when_ to use that technique, instead of some other.

Example: Doing a quick page by page **picture walk** of a chapter in a textbook before you begin to study it, may allow you to gain a sense of the big picture. So can listening to a well-organized lecture.

Outlines, flow charts, tables, concept maps, etc give you the context.

Start big, then get into the details.

_Chunks are best formed with:_

1. Focused attention
2. Understanding
3. Practice

**Summary**

- There is a bottom-up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed.
- There is a top-down "big picture" process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in.
- Both bottom-up chunking process and top-down "big picture" processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material.
- Chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem-solving technique.

#### Illusions of Competence

- Importance of Recall
- Min-testing
- Value of making mistakes

**Recall**: After reading material, simply look away and see what you can recall from it. Far more effective than using other approaches, such as re-reading or drawing concept maps. Mental retrieval of key ideas is vastly better method.

Glancing at a solution and thinking you know it yourself is one of the most common **illusions of competence** in learning.

Mistakes allow you to make repairs in your thinking flaws. Help correct your thinking.

Recalling material outside of your usual place of study is very helpful! Get used to learning and recalling ideas that weren't formed in the environment you were initially in.

### Seeing the Bigger Picture

#### What Motivates You?

Three neuromodulators were discussed in this video--acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. Each neuromodulator affects or signals for a particular type of behavior.

- Acetylcholine affects focused learning and attention
- Dopamine signals in relation to unexpected rewards
- Serotonin affects social life and risk taking behavior

#### The Value of a Library of Chunks

- Build up a large library of chunks!
- Chunks can help you understand new concepts; that chunk might be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, in the same or different fields. This is called _transfer_ -- a physics chunk may transfer over to a business chunk, for instance.
- Chunk is a way to compress info much more compactly.

Two ways to figure something out or solve problems:

- Sequential, step by step reasoning. Involves focused mode. Each small step leads deliberately toward a solution.
- Holistic intuition. Creative, diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts. Most difficult problems are grasped through intuition. Semi-random way of making connections; solutions it provides should be carefully verified using focused mode.

**Law of Serendipity**
Lady Luck favors the one who tries. Just focus on whatever section you're studying. Once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, the second will go in a little more easily, the third more easily still.

#### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, Chunking, and Interleaving

**Overlearning**: Continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session. Can help produce an automaticity when executing a serve in tennis. TED Talk guests can practice up to 70 hours for a single 20 minute talk. But be weary of repetitive overlearning in a single session; waste of valuable learning time. Doesn't strengthen long-term memory connections. Use a subsequent study session is often valuable. But over-repeating something you know well may bring in the illusion of competence that you've mastered the full-range of material, when you've only mastered the easy material.

Focusing on the more difficult material is called **Deliberate Practice**.

**Einstellung**: Your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed may prevent a better idea or solution from being found. Means "mindset". Like installing a roadblock because of the way you initially looked at something. Unlearn your erroneous old ideas or approaches.

Jumping into the water before you learn to swim. Blindly starting homework before relevant lectures, etc. Learn the basic chunks, and how to select and use different chunks. Practice jumping back and forth between problems that require different techniques or strategies -- this is called **Interleaving**. Once you have the basic idea down, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types, or different types of approaches / concepts / procedures.

_How_ to use a particular concept or approach isn't enough. Also need to know _when_ to use it. May make things seem more difficult, but actually learning more deeply. When deeply specializing in only one field, you may become too entrenched in familiar ways of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas.

#### Summary for Module 2

- Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and meaning. Can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory. Best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help deepen patterns and gain big-picture context. Simple recall is one of best ways to help chunking process. Try recalling material in different settings.

- Transfer is the idea that a chunk mastered in one area can help you master chunks in different areas.

- Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session.

- Chunks are important, but don't build flexibility, which is important in becoming an expert.

- Illusions of competence in learning -- learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning material. Test yourself frequently. Mini-tests. Recall is a form of mini-testing. Minimize highlighting -- fool you into thinking material is going into your brain. Mistakes are good -- allow you to catch illusions of competence. Avoid practicing only the easy stuff -- use deliberate practice of what you find most difficult.

- Einstellung is when your initial thought, idea, or neural pattern you've developed prevents a better idea or solution from being found. Keeps you from being too inflexible to find better approaches.

- Law of Serendipity, pick one tiny thing out to learn, and then another -- you'll be surprised at the results!

## Week 3 - Procrastination and Memory

### Procrastination

#### Introduction to Procrastination and Memory

Building solid chunks in long-term memory takes time; don't want to be putting it off. This week we will learn more on how procrastination happens, and simple ways to tackle it. We'll also learn about some of the best ways to access your brain's most powerful long-term memory systems.

#### Tackling Procrastination

It's easier and more valuable than you think!

Pomodoro is one way to help with procrastination.

Inner zombies -- the routine, habitual responses brain falls into as a result of specific cues. These responses are often focused on making the here-and-now better. We can trick these zombies into fending off procrastination when we need to.

Willpower uses a lot of neuro resources; don't use it for fending off procrastination until absolutely necessary.

We procrastination on things we feel uncomfortable towards. We get unhappy feeling, then funnel attention onto a more pleasant task, feel better (temporary). But the long-term affects of avoidance can become nasty! It's a bad habit that influences many areas of your life. Fixing it will help unfold many positive changes!

We may devise irrational excuses for avoiding studying. We can become the master of our habit; we make the decisions, not our zombies!

#### Zombies Everywhere

Chunking is related to habit. Habit is an energy-saver for us; allows us to free our mind for other types of activities. You don't have to think in a focused manner about what you're doing while you're performing a habit.

Habits can be good and bad. They can be brief or long.

Habits have four parts:

1. The cue: The trigger that launches you into "zombie mode". Seeing the first item in your to-do list (time to start homework), seeing a text message (time to stop work). Cue by itself is neither harmful or helpful. It's our routine (reaction) that matters.
2. The routine: Our zombie mode. The routine, habitual response our brain is used to falling into when we receive the cue.
3. The reward: Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us; immediate feeling of pleasure. Procrastination's reward happens so quickly and easily. But you can find ways to reward good habits to escape procrastination.
4. The belief: Habits have powers because of your belief in them. To change your habit you'll need to change your underlying belief.

#### Surf is Up: Process Versus Product

Effective in learning requires using mental tools and tricks to inspire and motivate yourself.

- Put negative thinking aside: "Quit wasting time and get on with it -- you'll feel better soon!"
- Learn to focus on _Process_, not _Product_

**Process**

Flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time. "I'm going to spend 20 minutes working". Small chunks of time you need over days or even weeks to answer the questions or prepare for tests.

**Product**

Outcome. The answers to the questions. The homework assignment you need to finish. It's what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastination.

Focus on building processes, not the product. Processes relate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.

Calmly put forth your best effort for a short period -- the process.

Focus on doing a Pomodoro, not on completing a task. Zombie, habitual part of our brain likes processes! It's far easier to enlist a zombie habit to help with the process rather than the product. Allows you to back away from judging yourself -- instead allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.

Train yourself to let distractions float by. Helps to set yourself up in an environment that minimizes distractions to begin with; a quiet space, noise-canceling headphones can be helpful.

#### Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You

Zombies can help us avoid procrastination while minimizing the need for willpower.

**The trick to overriding a habit is to look to change your reaction to a cue. The only place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue.** It helps to go back through the four components of habit and re-analyze them through the perspective of procrastination:

1. Recognizes what launches you into your zombie procrastination mode (the cue). Cues typically fall into 4 categories:
   - Location
   - Time
   - How you feel
   - Reactions

- Shut off cell phone
- Keep yourself away from Internet

2. The routine. This is the reaction point where you must actively focus on rewiring your old habit. The key to rewiring is to have a _plan_! Developing a new ritual can be helpful. Leave phone in car when heading into class. Settle into a quiet place. Sit in a favorite chair. Adjust the plan when necessary.
3. The reward. Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute an emotional payoff -- a feeling of pride, a sense of satisfaction? Can you win a small internal bet or contest about something you've turned into a personal game? Allow yourself to indulge in a latte or visit a favorite website? Reward self with an evening of mindless television without guilt? Bigger reward for bigger achievement. Helps to add new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings for procrastination. Only once your brain starts expecting that reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits. Setting a reward for a specific time may give a solid mini-deadline that can help spur work.
4. The belief. The belief that you can change your procrastination habit will be tremendously helpful. Hang out with people with the can-do outlook that you want to develop.

#### Juggling Life and Learning

- Weekly list of key tasks
- Daily "To-Do" list

Once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal. Each day on another page write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish. Try to write the daily task on the evening before. Helps your subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list so you can figure out how to accomplish them. Writing the list before you sleep enlists your zombies to help you accomplish the items on the list the next day. If you don't write your tasks down in a list, they can lurk at the edge of the four or so slots in your working memory, taking up valuable mental real estate.

Mixing other tasks up with your learning seems to make everything more enjoyable and keeps you from prolonged and unhealthy bouts of sitting. Break your to-do tasks up with diffuse mode tasks that you would normally not enjoy (like doing dishes); since they are now positioned in a way that gives you a break from focused-mode thinking, you'll find them more enjoyable!

Make notes about what works and what doesn't.

**Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time!**

Breaks are important, as is leisure time!

"Eat your frogs first in the morning". Try to work on the most important and most disliked tasks first -- for at least one Pomodoro as soon as you wake up.

#### Summing Up Procrastination

Learning well provides bit by bit, day by day building of solid neural scaffolds. Avoiding procrastination is thus important.

1. Keep a planner journal
   - Track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work
2. Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day
   - Write your tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on goals and help ensure success
   - Arrange work into series of small challenges
   - Ensure you and your zombies get lots of rewards
   - Take time to savior feelings happiness and triumph (and brain can temporarily change modes)
3. Delay rewards until you finish the task
4. Watch for procrastination cues
   - Put yourself in new surroundings with fewer potential cues
5. Gain trust in your new system
   - Work hard during times of focused concentration
   - Able to relax without feelings of guilt or worry
6. Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate
7. Eat your frogs first, every day!

#### Retrieval Practice

A Practice Quiz with 6 questions. I scored 100%!

### Memory

#### Diving Deeper Into Memory

Tap into naturally super-sized visual, spacial memorization abilities. "Where things are" and "how they look" memory system -- visual memory system.
Create vivid images to remember a math formula, for instance. The funnier and more evocative the images, the better.

Images connect directly to your right brain's visual spacial centers. Help you encapsulate the seemingly humdrum and hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.

Focusing your attention brings something into your temporary working memory. But for that something to move from working to long-term memory, two things should happen:

1. The idea should be memorable. The more memorable, the easier it will be to recall.
2. Must be repeated (with spaced repetition, not cramming), or the metabolic vampires will suck away the neural pattern related to that memory before it can strengthen and solidify!

Handwriting can be useful for helping you strengthen what you're trying to learn.

You'll want to say the word and its meaning aloud to start setting auditory hooks to the material.

#### What Is Long Term Memory

Hippocampus is important part of a brain system for learning and memory of facts and events. Without it, or after severe damage to it, it's not possible to store new memories (memory consolidation).

Memories are not fixed; they are living, breathing and changing all the time. Whenever you recall a memory, it changes (process called reconsolidation). It's possible to plant false memories.

Astrocytes are brain cells that:

- Provide nutrients to neurons
- Maintain extracellular (outside the cell) ion balance
- Are involved in repair after injury
- Have a role in learning

(Pretty technical section -- probably don't need notes!)

#### Create Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups to simplify the material. Four plants to help ward off vampire? Garlic, Rose, Hawthorn, Mustard. Take the first letter of each word (GHRM), this looks like the word "Graham", so maybe we can remember these four plants by picturing a graham cracker.

Much easier to remember numbers by associating them with memorable events.

Memorable sentences. First letter of each word in a sentence is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized: "Some lovers try positions that they can't handle" to memorize the name of the carpal bones of the hand, for instance. "Old people from Texas eat spider" for the cranial bones.

**Memory Palace Technique**

Powerful way of grouping things you want to remember.

- Call to mind a familiar place (like layout of your house) and using it as a visual notepad where you can deposit the concept images that you want to remember.
- Useful for remembering unrelated items, like grocery list. Imagine a bottle of milk inside your front door, the bread plopped on teh couch, an egg spilling off the coffee table. Imagine you're walking through a place you know very well and encountering these shockingly memorable images of what you want to remember.

It takes time to conjure up a solid mental image. With practice and repetition, the memory palace technique becomes easier and stronger.

Can also strengthen your creativity! Speed up acquisition of both chunks and big-picture templates helping transform novices to semi-experts much more quicker. Expand working memory with easy access to long-term memory. The memory process itself becomes an exercise in creativity.

#### Summing Up Memory

Key ideas about memory:

- Two main memory systems involved in ability to chunk concepts: 1. Long-term memory (storage warehouse, practice and repeat over time in order to store items here). 2. Working memory (poor blackboard that quickly fades, only hold about 4 items in working memory). When you master a technique, it compacts the ideas so they occupy less working memory space. This frees mental thinking space so it can more easily grapple with other ideas.
