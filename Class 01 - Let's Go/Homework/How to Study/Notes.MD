# Active Recall | Evidence-Based Revision Tips

These are some of my notes while watching `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE`.

This video covers the concept of _active recall_.

Overview:

- 1:29 - Three popular but inefficient techniques like rereading, highlighting and summarizing / making notes.
- 6:42 - Active Recall, and the evidence behind why it's the most effective revision strategy
- 13:41 - Specific, practical strategies for incorporating Active Recall into your revision / study routine

## Part 1 - Popular But Inefficient Techniques

1. **Re-Reading**

- Low utility. Waste of time compared to other techniques.
- Produces little or no benefit, but is typically a student's number one choice for studying.

2. **Highlighting**

- Low utility. Little to boost performance
- Inference making subjects gain no benefit
- Highlighting effectively produces some results, but is rarely done effectively, even when possible

3. **Summarizing / Making Notes**

- Good summarizing students do perform slightly better
- Can be effective learning strategy for learners already skilled at summarizing, but requires extensive training to reach this point
- But even then, it's still low utility compared to other methods

## Part 2 - Active Recall & The Evidence Behind It

So what is an effective technique?

Active Recall / Active Retrieval is the most important technique! Retrieving facts from brain. The very act strengthens the connections. Practicing writing down as much as you can remember after the study session.

- High utility
- Not time-intensive, implemented with minimal training
- Students saw 10%-15% just by having one practice test at the end of the study session
- Practice testing once was more beneficial than re-reading the study material 4x

## Part 3 - Active Recall - Specific Strategies You Can Use

So how can you go about using active recall or practices testing in your own studying?

Anything you do that requires you to use brain-power to retrieve information that you've previously learned will help!

1. App called Anki. It is a flashcard app. Good for memorizing particular facts.
2. Making notes (even spider diagrams) with the book closed. Learn a topic, close book, write out how you would explain the topic to someone else. After, open the book and see the parts you've missed.
3. Write questions! Alternative to making notes. Cornell note taking system (sort-of). Write questions for yourself based on the material, such that when you revise the material you look at your questions and try to actively answer them. Instead of passively re-reading, engage in cognitive effort to retrieve information.

## Part 4 - Summary

- Re-reading, highlighting, summarizing / notes are not very effective revision techniques.
- Active recall is effective! "Make It Stick" is a good book to reference this.
- Spaced repetition is also effective, which will be learned in the next lecture.

# Spaced Repetition | Evidence-Based Revision Tips

These are some of my notes while watching `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM`.

This video covers the concept of **spaced repetition**.

Overview:

- 1:05 - Spaced repetition vs cramming, and spaced repetition within the same study session + a bit of evidence
- 8:37 - Tips for incorporating spaced repetition into your own study routine and life in general
- 11:30 - Ali's magical spaced repetition spreadsheet system for structuring revision in a fluid fashion

## Part 1 - Spaced Repetition + Evidence

Spaced your repetition of particular subjects over time. Opposite of cramming, basically.
Spread out revision over time, review topics (ideally via active recall)

_Forgetting Curve_

- Natural to forget things at an exponential rate over time
- Every time we interrupt the forgetting curve, it takes longer for us to forget something
- More time we do this, the more spaced out our repetition needs to be, more likely we'll encode into our long-term memory. Forgetting curve no longer applies to this piece of knowledge!
- For example, active recall one hour later, then one day, then three days, then a week, then a month
- The harder your brain has to work to retrieve, the stronger that information gets encoded
- Spaced repetition allows your brain to forget some pieces, so when you revise again it's not mindless repetition -- it actually takes some brain power

Even studying in small chunks in one day is better. For example, if you're learning a new word, rather than repeating / recalling it 10x before moving on to the next word, it's better to recall it once, move onto some new words, recall it once more, move onto some new words, etc -- all within the same small study session. Up to 50-80% more effective than not spacing out the recalls!

So, a common, ineffective study session involving 5 topics might typically look like this:

```
9am: Study topic 1
11am: Study topic 2
1pm: Study topic 3
3pm: Study topic 4
5pm: STudy topic 5
```

With just a small modification, we can be 50-80% more effective:

```
9am: Study topic 1
11am: Review topic 1 briefly, study topic 2
1pm: Review topic 2 briefly, study topic 3
3pm: Review topic 3 briefly, study topic 4
5pm: Review topic 4 briefly, study topic 5
7pm: Review ALL briefly
```

(Note the times are just there for simplicity, and in fact the more effective study method doesn't need to take any longer than the first)

At end of day, write down everything you can remember in the form of a spider diagram.

## Part 2 - Tips for Applying Spaced Repetition

These are just personal tips from the author. Try whatever seems to work best.

1. Flashcards, especially via Anki app
2. Mindset to appreciate the power of spaced repetition, consistency, and patience. Practice a little each day

## Part 3 - The Magical Spaced Repetition Spreadsheet

Use a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Excel (preferably one with access to an app). Make a different sheet for each subject. Within each subject, within the A column write a list of every single topic in that broad subject.

**Scoping your subject**

Even if it takes a full day, invest in spending the time finding out and writing down a list of all topics! Don't scope too deep. Physics, for example, could probably be categorized into only 4 topics (for first year). Every time you _actively recall_ from that topic (not re-read about it!), write the date down in the B column by that topic. The next time you actively recall a topic, put the date you recalled it in the C column, etc. Color code each box based on how good your recall was (poor, very well, etc).

## Part 4 - Tips for using the Magical Spaced Repetition System

- Start with the stuff you do not know
- Start with final topic and work your way back
- Scattershot approach, fill in as many boxes as you possibly can (ie breadth approach over subjects / topics). Interleaving practice - do a little bit of one thing, just before you have mastery of it switch to something else. Don't treat a revision as "A block of HTML, and then a block of CSS". Instead, combine everything together, a bit of each.
- Large number of topics over fine detail of a few

## Part 5 - Why I Don't like Revision Timetables

- Bad because you're expecting yourself to know how much you need to revise a particular topic
- Repeating topics you don't need to repeat, or not enough time for others
- Fluid process, hard to plan revision in advance

## Part 6 - Summary & Closing Remarks

- Spacing repetition is better than cramming
- Within a single study session, spacing repetition is good
- Techniques like Anki, mindset shift -- a little bit each day
- Magical spreadsheet for spaced repetition. Good to visualize progress and what needs to be focused on
