## Part One - Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

### 1. "If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive"

- Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify themselves. It wounds a person's pride, hurts their sense of important, and arouses resentment.
- Condemnation will simply make the recipient return it to us.
- Change and regulate yourself, not others!
- People are creatures of emotion, not logic. They are bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
- Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.
- Try to understand people instead of condemning. It's more profitable, and it breeds sympathy, tolerance, and kindness.

**PRINCIPLE 1 - Don't Criticize, Condemn or Complain**

### 2. The Big Secret of Dealing With People

- To get someone to do something, _make them want to do it!_ Do this by giving them what they want.
- The deepest urge in human nature is **"the desire to be important."** (or **"the desire to be great"**)
- Arouse enthusiasm by showing appreciation and encouragement.
- Be _sincere_! The difference between flattery and appreciation is sincerity. Only a fool will fall for flattery.

**PRINCIPLE 2 - Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation**

### 3. "He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way"

- Everybody is interested in what they want. So talk about what they want, and show them how to get it!
- Every action you take was made because you wanted _something_.
- Arouse in another person an eager want. If you want to persuade somebody to do something, before speaking, ask yourself: "How can I make this person want to do it?"
- Get the **other person's point of view** and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own, then arouse an eager want.
- Even just showing enthusiasm for something may arouse a person's want.
- This sounds like manipulation, but it isn't; each party should gain from the negotiation.
- "Self-expression is the dominate necessity of human nature." So, when we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them think it's theirs? They will regard it as their own, like it as their own.

**PRINCIPLE 3 - Arouse in the other person an eager want**
