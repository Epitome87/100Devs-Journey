## The Box Model

Everything is a box!

## Layouts - Floats

- A float tries as hard as it can to go into a corner (top left if left float, top right if right float).
- Side effect: Create layouts where elements sit next to one another
- They're floated off the page -- content after it floats underneath as rise to the top
- So we need to _clear_ the float on the elements after it: `clear: both;` or `clear: left` or `clear: right;`

## Questions / Possible Ankis

None really. Very small amount of new material, one of which is very basic and the other which is outdated.
