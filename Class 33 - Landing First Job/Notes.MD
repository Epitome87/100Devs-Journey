## Crafting Your Story

Your story should answer: "Why are you here?"

- This will help us pass the sniff test
  - We don't want to smell like a bootcamper!
- Need to get to the nerds (people on the engineering team)
- Then it's: "Can you code? And do I want to work with you for the next two years?"

We can pass the sniff test by crafting our stories in a way that avoids mentioning bootcamps.

- Talk about your wins
- Freelancing, but tired of freelancing / agency life / chasing next meal. Ready to job a product team such as yours, excited to be talking to you today.

**Referrals** can help you pass the sniff test, and sometimes the first round of interviews. Referrals greatly increase the chance your resume goes from never being seen to at least being genuinely considered.

Twitter is a great way to connect with people for potential referrals.

- Follow **50** engineers in the area you will be applying. Or look for remote developer hashtags and follow 50 people using those hashtags.
- Like, Retweet, Follow these people. Comment once in a while. Simple engagement.
- "Hey, been following your content for a while, love what you share. Do you mind 10-15 minutes of your time to hear about where you go where you are?"
- Read Hackernews, Tweet what you read that day on it, simple Tweets like that.
- Use Buffer to automate Tweets.

## Hitlist

One of the most important things you will ever do for your career.

Add individuals you want to network to _"the sheet"_.

Network your way into 60 _recommended_ applications! Never apply without networking and being recommended first.

Find the hiring manager:

- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
  - "Hey, I saw you work in Boston, you're really into TS -- something I've been getting into -- would you be up to having a coffee chat? Would love to
  - Don't be upfront and just say "Hey I want the job you're offering".
  - Let it come up naturally: "Hey, we have an open role at the company". "Ohh? Would you mind referring me?"
    learn more about how you got to where you are."
  - If at no point their opening comes up naturally in this talk, follow-up in email two weeks later and mention you saw an opening at their company: "Would you mind referring me?"
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation

Now when you talk to the recruiter, you can name-drop the previous people you've talked to! The recruiter wouldn't be very good if they don't recruit you after hearing you've had a pleasant time with some company members.

Just remember, **never just hit apply!**

## 100 Hours Project
