## Resume

Good template: Bob Boberson (download from attachments).

`https://cvcompiler.com/`: (Run your resume through to see what recruiters see **don't pay**)

Once we have our hitlist, we will make multiple versions.

**Some Tips**

Average view-time of a resume is only _6 seconds_! So be clear, concise, focus on quality.

- One page!
- Use _software engineer_ as title.
- **Do not put photo!** Some recruiters can't even accept those with a photo.
- **Do not put a location**.
- Summary: Quick, short, to the point. Hit keywords, even if you just have an _interest_ in them. Can end with good reason why you're applying.
- Focus on the _story_ on why you showed up. "Tired of freelance grind, finding customers every month. I want to join company that supports a product that people use."
- Don't be negative in your story. "I hate my current job."
- No room for humble pie! No "aspiring", "junior", etc.
- Always label your projects as if they were real companies for real clients.
- Don't "snitch on yourself" -- don't put projects that are obviously bootcamp or tutorial projects. It will negate your bigger projects.
  - If you do put these projects, **brand** them: "Slot Machine App" is now "Small Lakes Casino Virtual Slot Machine".
  - "Color Picker" is "On-demand background color changer for Partnered Twitch streamer".
- Three work histories:
  - 1st can be 100Devs
  - Your consulting. This starts the day you start learning how to code! "Full Stack Web Developer at Bob's Consulting"
    - Especially useful for gaps. Have one actual client that employers can talk to.
    - Best time ever to have a gap due to Covid.
  - Any previous jobs. Could be outside of the tech industry as well. Put actual title, though. If possible, tilt what you did there in a way that benefits a software engineer role. This is where your "story" becomes important. "I was a server and their point of sales system sucked. I knew I could code a better one myself."
- Volunteering: Maybe at a conference. Preferably technical volunteering. Helps you find common bond with interviewer, especially if you're both local.
- Skills: Computer reads your resume, so this is helpful.
- Education: Do not emphasize it first unless you went to a really top school. Leave dates off if it was long ago.
- Leave soft skills off resume (MS Word, Communication, etc).
- Leave course certifications off, unless they're very prestigious and rigorous.
- Rule of thumb: "Does this piece of information contribute to my story of why I'm a software engineer?"
