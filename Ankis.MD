# Anki

Here I will write out questions after each lecture or study assignment, as a way to actively recall what I just learned. Some of these will also be added to my Anki collection!

## Week 01

### Class 01

**Assignment #01**: Watch video on Active Recall `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE`

Q1. What are some common revision techniques student use and think are effective, but are actually not?

- Re-reading
- Highlighting
- Summarizing / Note-making

Q2. What are two names for the most effective revision technique?

- Active Recall
- Active Retrieval

Q3. What does Active Recall involve?

- As the name suggest, simply recalling the study material shortly after it was introduced. The more effort something requires to retrieve it, and the more often, the stronger the neural connections will be.

Q4. Research has shown which to be more effective -- active recalling once, or re-reading material four times?

- Active recalling just a single time was shown to be more effective than re-reading four times!

Q5. What are some things or tools you could use to promote active recall?

- Flash cards (with an app such as Anki)
- Writing down as much as you remember after a study session
- A practice test right after learning new material
- Writing notes in the form of questions

**Assignment #02**: Watch video on Active Recall `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM`

Q1. After Active Recall, what is the second important technique proven to help with studying? (The opposite of cramming)

- Spaced repetition

Q2. In general, what does spaced repetition involve?

- Spacing when you _actively recalling_ information. Spacing actions such as re-reading does not count!

Q3. Is spaced repetition useful only after completing a study session for the day?

- No; spaced repetition also has tremendous value when used _within_ a single study session.

Q4. What is the name of the curve that determines how we retain information over time?

- Forgetful Curve

Q5. What is the growth of the Forgetful Curve?

- It is an exponential decline over time

Q6. How can we "flatten" the Forgetful Curve?

- By actively recalling information in spaced repetitions. Each time we actively recall information, we improve the amount of information we will remember and how long it will take to forget. Eventually the curve is flat; the information is part of our long-term memory.

Q7. What is "The Magical Spreadsheet"?

- It is Ali's personal technique for implementing spaced repetition. It involves using a spreadsheet and writing the name of broad subjects as different sheets, and in those sheets writing down a comprehensive list of topics (scoped appropriately). Every time you actively recall information from that topic, put the current date in a column beside it. Color code each cell to represent how well / easily you actively recalled. Focus on new information first, and information you perform poorly on. Take a quantity over quality approach -- attempting to visit many topics on a general level rather than the fine details of a single topic.

Q8. What is "Interleaving Practice"?

- It is the concept of working on something and _just_ before mastery, moving onto a new concept.
