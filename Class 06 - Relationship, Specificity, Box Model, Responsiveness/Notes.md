## Reset

Gets rid of every single default styling. Start from scratch. H1 will look like span, etc.

## Normalize

Keep some of the default styling, but that default styling is consistent across every browser.

## Media Queries

**The mechanism that allows our sites to be responsive**. They are writing in a syntax like:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```
