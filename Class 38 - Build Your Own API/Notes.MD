# Class 38 - Build Your Own API (Hosted on Heroku)

Our backend API:
"It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it."

**CRUD**

Create (post) - Make something
Read (get) - Get something
Update (put) - Change something
Delete (delete) - Remove something

## Express

"Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. WIth a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy."
